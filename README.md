Multi-CDN Switching with API-Driven Optimization
This project implements a Multi-CDN Switching mechanism to optimize content delivery, enhance performance, and ensure high availability for web applications. By integrating multiple CDNs such as Cloudflare and AWS CloudFront, the system dynamically switches between them based on real-time performance data, ensuring users are always served by the fastest and most reliable network.

Key Features
✅ Real-Time Performance Monitoring – Tracks CDN response times, latency, and error rates.
✅ Automated CDN Switching – Dynamically routes traffic to the best-performing CDN without manual intervention.
✅ Load Balancing & Failover – Ensures smooth transitions and redundancy in case of CDN failures.
✅ Cost Optimization – Routes traffic based on the most cost-effective CDN considering geographical and temporal factors.
✅ Custom API-Driven Solution – Fetches real-time CDN performance metrics and triggers intelligent switching.

Project Roadmap
1️⃣ Research & Selection – Choose the best CDN providers and define key performance metrics.
2️⃣ System Architecture Design – Implement DNS-based routing and failover mechanisms.
3️⃣ CDN Integration & Setup – Configure multiple CDNs and connect them to the monitoring system.
4️⃣ API Development – Build a monitoring API to fetch real-time performance metrics.
5️⃣ Dynamic Switching Implementation – Enable automated traffic routing based on collected data.
6️⃣ Testing & Optimization – Evaluate performance under load, verify failover handling, and fine-tune APIs.
